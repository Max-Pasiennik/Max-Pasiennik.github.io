            <h2>Program Origins and History</h2>
            <p>The buffalo was officially chosen as the University of Colorado's mascot in 1934. Live bison appeared on the sidelines at football games on-and-off for the next several decades. In 1957, Mr. Chips became the first named bison affiliated with the program.</p>
            <p>The bison that became Ralphie I was donated by John Lowery, the father of a CU student in 1966. While she only watched from the sidelines originally, by 1967, it was determined that she would run on the field prior to games to intimidate the other team. Ralphie I was kidnapped in 1970 by Air Force Academy students. She was also named the school’s 1971 Homecoming Queen.</p>
            <p>All subsequent Ralphies have also been donated to the university. Ralphie II debuted before the second half of the final home game in 1978, after Ralphie I ran for the final time before the game. In 1986, Oklahoma State pranksters snuck into their college’s veterinary clinic and sprayed painted “OSU” on Ralphie's back in orange letters. On September 19, 1987, Ralphie II unexpectedly died the night after she ran during a game. Ralphie III was already preparing to take over in 1988, but was pressed into action sooner than anticipated.</p>

            <h2>Ralphie Handlers</h2>
            <p>The Ralphie Handlers are a group of approximately 15 varsity student-athletes that volunteer 20 or more hours per week for the program in physical training, practicing, making appearances, and caring for Ralphie.</p>
            <p>Initially called "The Men Who Run with Ralphie," the name was changed to "Ralphie Runners" in 1970. As the responsibilities and duties of the students on the team increased from just running with Ralphie to assisting in her overall care and maintenance, the name "Ralphie Handlers" was adopted in the 1980s. Handlers first started earning varsity letters in 1987. Even though the Handlers do not fall under NCAA jurisdiction, the Athletic Department still holds them to the same standards as other varsity athletes in the department. The first female joined the Ralphie Handlers in 1992.</p>
            <p>Taylor Stratton has been the program manager and head coach since 2020, replacing John Graves after five years. Prior to Graves, Gail Pederson directed the program for 17 years. Both Stratton and her assistants were Ralphie Handlers when they were students at Colorado. Whether or not Ralphie runs is at the sole discretion of the program manager, and her run may be canceled for any reason deemed to be in her best interest.</p>

            <h2>Ralphie's Run and Other Activities</h2>
            <p>Ralphie travels to and from her home ranch in a custom-designed trailer. It is insulated with vents that can be opened and closed to adjust airflow and temperature. The inside walls and floor are lined with rubber mats for her comfort. There is enough space for her to walk around, turn around, and lie down. Special gates can be closed to allow the Handlers to easily and safely attach her harness and headstall on her and bring her in and out of the trailer.</p>
            <p>The activity for which Ralphie is most well-known is her run across the field prior to each half of Buffaloes' home games. She usually arrives on the field about one hour before kickoff on regular game days, staying in her pen until the game is about to begin. As the public address announcer exclaims "Here comes Ralphie!" the pen is opened and Ralphie and her handlers begin their run.</p>

        <section id="ranch">
            <h2>Ralphie's Ranch</h2>
            <p>Ralphie lives on a ranch in an undisclosed location to protect her and provide her with an ideal living environment. Only people associated with the program are permitted to visit her at the ranch. Ralphie has access to shelters that allow her to avoid bad weather, however, the program reports that she enjoys being outside regardless of temperature or precipitation. Ralphie's pasture contains large scratching posts made of old street sweeper brushes donated by the city of Boulder.</p>
            <p>Ralphie is fed grass hay daily to supplement the grass she grazes. She can eat up to 30 pounds of grasses and hay daily, and drinks 10-15 gallons of water. Her manure is gathered daily and composted. During the summer months, various fly control methods are utilized to combat the nuisance of flies around Ralphie.</p>
            <p>In addition to the Ralphie Handlers and coaches, she also has a veterinarian who provides wellness exams and vaccinations. According to the school's official Ralphie website, inspections are conducted annually by the university's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The program's USDA Class C exhibitor's license subjects it to unannounced inspections to ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.</p>
